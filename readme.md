# PoloBot
A trading bot for the Poloniex Exchange

## Installation

You need to install this first

`pip3 install https://github.com/s4w3d0ff/python-poloniex/archive/v0.4.6.zip`

(I couldn't find a way to to install a working poloniex wrapper from setup.py - this is a workaround for now)

then run
`python3 setup.py`
